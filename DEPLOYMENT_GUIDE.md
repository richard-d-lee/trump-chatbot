## Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start

**Problem**: Service fails to start or shows errors in logs

**Solutions**:
1. Check that `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly in environment variables
2. Verify all files were uploaded to GitHub (especially `src/` folder)
3. Check the build logs for Python dependency errors
4. Make sure `requirements.txt` is in the root directory
5. Ensure `python-dotenv` is in `requirements.txt`

### OpenAI API Errors

**Problem**: Chat messages return errors or only fallback responses

**Solutions**:
1. Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
2. Check your OpenAI account at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
3. Make sure the API key starts with `sk-`
4. Try regenerating your API key if it's expired
5. Add billing information to your OpenAI account

### Custom Domain Not Working

**Problem**: Custom domain doesn't load or shows SSL errors

**Solutions**:
1. Wait longer - DNS can take up to 48 hours (usually 10-60 minutes)
2. Clear your browser cache and try incognito mode
3. Verify the CNAME record is pointing to the correct URL
4. Check your DNS settings are correct

### Database Errors

**Problem**: User login or conversation history not working

**Solutions**:
1. SQLite database is created automatically on first run
2. Make sure the `src/database/` directory exists
3. For Render: Enable persistent disk in service settings
4. For Railway: Database files persist automatically

### Trump Image Not Loading

**Problem**: Trump portrait doesn't appear in header

**Solutions**:
1. Add a Trump image to `src/static/images/trump.png`
2. Or remove the image element from `index.html`
3. Check browser console for 404 errors
